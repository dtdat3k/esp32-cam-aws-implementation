# ESP32-CAM AWS Implementation

This project demonstrates how to integrate an ESP32-CAM module with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The implementation enables the ESP32-CAM to capture images and communicate with AWS services for storage, processing, or further actions. It is ideal for IoT, remote monitoring, and smart surveillance applications.

## Overview

This project integrates the ESP32-CAM with AWS to create an end-to-end solution that captures images, processes them, and uploads them to AWS. It leverages AWS services such as IoT Core, S3, or Lambda to create a robust remote monitoring and image processing system.

## Features

- **Image Capture:** Uses the ESP32-CAM module to capture images.
- **AWS Integration:** Sends images and data to AWS for storage or further processing.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Optionally streams images or sends alerts in real time.
- **Configurable:** Easy configuration for Wi-Fi and AWS credentials.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Organized code for camera operations, AWS communication, and system configuration.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** ESP32-CAM module, USB-to-serial adapter, appropriate wiring (GND, VCC, TX, RX, IO0).
- **Software:** Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
- **AWS Account:** An AWS account with permissions for IoT Core, S3, and/or Lambda.
- **Basic Knowledge:** Familiarity with Arduino programming and IoT concepts.

## Hardware Setup

1. **Connect the ESP32-CAM Module:**
   - Connect the ESP32-CAM to your computer using a USB-to-serial adapter.
   - Ensure the following connections:
     - **GND:** Connect to ground.
     - **VCC:** Supply 5V (check your module specifications).
     - **TX/RX:** Connect to corresponding pins on the adapter.
     - **IO0:** Connect to GND to enter flashing mode (disconnect after upload).

2. **Verify Wiring:** Double-check all connections before powering the module.

## Software Setup

### Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-cam-aws-implementation.git
cd esp32-cam-aws-implementation
```

### Open the Project

- Use the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO to open the project folder.

### Install Dependencies

- Install the ESP32 board definitions via the Boards Manager in the Arduino IDE.
- Install any additional libraries required (e.g., `WiFi`, `ArduinoJson`).

### Configure Project Settings

- Open the `config.h` file (or equivalent configuration file) and update:
  - **Wi-Fi Credentials:** SSID and password for your network.
  - **AWS Credentials:** AWS endpoint, IoT thing certificate, private key, and any other necessary configurations.

## Code Overview

- **main.ino / main.cpp:** Initializes the system, handles camera capture, and manages AWS communication.
- **aws_client.cpp / aws_client.h:** Contains functions to establish a connection with AWS and handle API calls.
- **camera_module.cpp / camera_module.h:** Manages the camera initialization and image capture.
- **config.h:** Stores all configurable parameters like Wi-Fi and AWS credentials.

## Uploading the Code

1. **Select Board:** Choose the correct ESP32 board (e.g., ESP32 Wrover Module).
2. **Select Port:** Ensure the correct COM port is selected.
3. **Upload:** Click "Upload" in the Arduino IDE.
4. **Reset:** After uploading, disconnect IO0 from GND and reset the module.

## AWS Configuration

### AWS IoT Core

- Create a new Thing in AWS IoT.
- Generate and download the device certificate and private key.
- Attach a policy that grants the necessary permissions.

### AWS S3

- Create an S3 bucket to store the captured images.
- Configure the bucket policy as needed.

### AWS Lambda (Optional)

- Create a Lambda function to process or analyze the images received.
- Configure triggers if you want to automate image processing.

Update the corresponding settings in your project configuration file.

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Power On:** Connect the ESP32-CAM module to a power source.
2. **Monitor Serial Output:** Open the serial monitor to check the connection status and debugging messages.
3. **Image Capture:** The module should capture an image and attempt to upload it to AWS.
4. **Verify on AWS:** Log in to your AWS console to confirm that the image or data has been received and stored.

## Troubleshooting

- **Wi-Fi Connection Issues:**
  - Ensure the SSID and password in `config.h` are correct.
  - Check network connectivity and signal strength.
- **AWS Connection Errors:**
  - Verify AWS credentials, certificates, and endpoint configurations.
  - Check that your AWS IoT policy allows the required actions.
- **Camera Initialization Problems:**
  - Confirm that the camera module is properly connected.
  - Review the code for proper camera configuration and initialization routines.
